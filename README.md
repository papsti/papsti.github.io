# papsti.github.io

Files that generate my personal website

## Development

### Workflow

- Branch from `main` to develop new content (see [Issues](https://github.com/papsti/papsti.github.io/issues) for ideas)
- Use `quarto preview` in Terminal to preview site locally
- Merge back into `main` when finished new content
- Site should render and publish automatically when changes are made to `main` via GitHub Actions
