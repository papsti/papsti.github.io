Here are some recent projects I've worked on.

# `{ern}`

I helped develop an **R package** that estimates the time-varying **reproduction number** while taking into account the quirks of **real-world infectious disease data**.

# `{EPACmodel}`

I developed an **R package** encoding a **generic compartmental disease model** as a starter to create more complex, **bespoke** models, in order to make my work at the Public Health Agency of Canada more **efficient** and **reproducible**.
